# 🧪 Modern Visual Periodic Table

An interactive, visually modern periodic table web application designed to make exploring chemical elements more engaging and intuitive.

Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project transforms the traditional periodic table into a responsive and animated experience. Users can click on any element to view detailed information, explore a dynamic Bohr model, and learn about discovery history—all in a visually appealing modal card.
